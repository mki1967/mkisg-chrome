by mki1967@gmail.com

This is the version of MKI SEARCHING GAME that can be run as Chrome application offline.

DESCRIPTION:

Searching in 3D stages.

You have to find and collect randomly scattered objects in a 3D stage.
After collecting the last token, you are transferred to another
randomly selected stage.
Sometimes it is hard to find all the tokens, since they can be anywhere.


INSTRUCTIONS:

Find all the red tokens to finish each stage. 
To collect a token you have simply to approach it.
You can go through the walls. 
They only restrict visibility.

* use arrow keys and IJKL to move / rotate left-right or up-down
* use F to move forward
* use B or V to move backward
* use M to switch to MOVE mode
* use R to switch to ROTATE mode
* use SPACE to reset vertical orientation

The screen is divided into 3x3 sectors.
You can also activate actions by clicking sectors on the screen.
You stop actions by clicking on the screen.

You can travel within bounding box of the stage. 
The frame of this box is visible.
When you reach the bounding box, you are automatically 
switched to ROTATE mode. 
It is more suitable for regaining orientation.

Hints: 

* MOVE mode can be used for systematic scanning of the stage
  in the search for an object. 

* When you are close to the object, it is easier to
  navigate toward the object in the ROTATE mode.
